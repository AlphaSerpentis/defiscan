| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | Users’ funds cannot be stolen, frozen or lost           |
| ❌     | Users’ unclaimed yield cannot be stolen, frozen or lost |
| ✅     | Users cannot be censored                                |
| ❌     | Users can opt-out of unwanted protocol changes          |

Note, these risks only account for observed centralization vectors and do not include other sources such as economic or technical flaws in the protocol design and implementation.

# Assessment

## Chain

This report covers the Velodrome v2 deployment on the Optimism mainnet. As Optimism is still evolving in terms of decentralization and governance, it does not yet meet the highest standard of decentralization (Stage 1 according to L2Beat).

## Upgradeability

The emergency council (multisig of ecosystem advocates, claimed to be credibly neutral) has a lot of control in the Velodrome system through killing and reviving gauges. Each gauge is linked to a pool. Voters and LP both incentivized through the Velodrome Flywheel are affected by a killed gauge which is linked to the deposited (LP) or voted (Voter) pool such that for the period in which the gauge was killed, the unclaimed rewards for this period are effectively lost. LPs and Voters need to re-allocate their capital and votes to earn rewards in the next period again.

## Autonomy

Velodrome v2 does not have external dependencies.

## Exit Window

Velodrome protocol does not provide an exit window for users in case of an unwanted upgrade or contract change. Changes made by the governor or the emergency council, such as killing gauges, are enforced immediately after the related transaction is processed. This immediate enforcement leaves users with no window to exit or withdraw their assets before the change is applied.

## Accessibility

Velodrome provides several access points to the protocol, both decentralized and centralized. Decentralized links include [velo.drome.eth](https://velo.drome.eth), [velo.drome.eth.limo](https://velo.drome.eth.limo), and [velo.drome.eth.link](https://velo.drome.eth.link), while centralized options include [velodrome.finance](https://velodrome.finance) and [alt.velodrome.finance](https://alt.velodrome.finance). This diversity of user interfaces offers redundancy and reduces risks associated with access issues.
