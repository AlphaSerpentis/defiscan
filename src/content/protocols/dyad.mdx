# Assessment

## Chain

DYAD is deployed on Ethereum mainnet.


## Upgradeability

DYAD Protocol relies on a multisig structure to control upgrades and critical contract functions. The **VaultManagerV4 **contract is upgradeable through the ERC-1967 and UUPS proxy patterns, which means its logic can be altered at any time. This introduces a risk that upgrades could lead to temporary freezing of assets or disruptions, especially since there are no timelocks in place to delay upgrades or give users time to react.  \
The **VaultLicenser** allows the multisig to add or remove vaults, and removing a vault from the registry freezes the associated collateral, preventing users from accessing their funds. This centralized control over key contract functions and immediate upgrade potential introduces the possibility of temporary freezing of assets or changes to the protocol’s performance.


## Autonomy

DYAD Protocol relies heavily on Chainlink oracles for the price feeds of collateral assets (WETH, stETH, TBTC, and sUSDe). If one of these price feeds stops functioning or becomes untrusted, the respective collateral is frozen. Users cannot withdraw or redeem this collateral, and liquidations are paused for that specific asset. However, burning DYAD remains possible in such situations. The protocol has no fallback mechanism for updating the price feeds, as the reference addresses are immutable. A failure in the oracle system could result in temporary freezing of assets, but the protocol continues to operate for other collateral types.


## Exit Window

DYAD Protocol does not provide an exit window for users in the event of contract changes. Specifically, the **VaultLicenser** allows the multisig to add or remove vaults without any timelock, which can result in the temporary locking of user funds. Similarly, the **VaultManagerV4** contract is upgradeable without a timelock, allowing immediate changes to critical functions like minting, burning, and liquidation. This absence of a delay before upgrades or vault removals means users have no window to react to unwanted changes.


## Accessibility

Dyad Protocol offers a single user interface accessible through its main web app. However, a self-hosted backup solution is available via its open-source frontend code, hosted on GitHub at[ https://github.com/DyadStablecoin/frontend](https://github.com/DyadStablecoin/frontend). This allows users to host their own version of the dApp, providing an additional layer of accessibility and resilience in case the main interface becomes unavailable.

|Licenser           |add The owner of the licenser contract can add new contracts that are allowed to mint DYAD, since the mint function of Dyad checks if isLicensed. The only contract that is currently to mint is VaultManager Proxy where users can interact with public endpoints to mint DYAD against collateral.|0xDeD796De6a14E255487191963dEe436c45995813 (Team multisig)                  |

|VaultLicenser      |add The owner of the VaultLicenser contract can add vault addresses to the registry. The accepted collateral in every vault that is listed in the VaultLicenser registry is accepted as collateral for minting DYAD.|0xDeD796De6a14E255487191963dEe436c45995813 (Team multisig)                  |
|VaultLicenser      |remove The owner of the VaultLicenser contract can remove vault addresses from the registry. Every vault that is removed from the registry is from this block forward not accepted as collateral for minting the protocol’s stablecoin DYAD. Moreover, the collateral deposited in the vaults is frozen and user’s cannot access their funds.|0xDeD796De6a14E255487191963dEe436c45995813 (Team multisig)                  |

|Notes              |mintInsiderNft The mintInsiderNft function allows the owner to mint up to 4000 Notes (dNFT) for free. The limit of 4000 notes is constant and immutable.|0xDeD796De6a14E255487191963dEe436c45995813 (Team multisig)                  |
|KerosineManager    |add The add function allows the owner of the permission to add new vaults. Each added vault allows a new type of collateral for backing DYAD. The max number of vaults is capped at 10 and this is immutable.|0xDeD796De6a14E255487191963dEe436c45995813 (Team multisig)                  |

|VaultManagerV4     |_authorizeUpgrade VaultManager is an upgradeable contract with ERC-1967 and UUPS pattern, thus the proxy upgrade logic is part of VaultManagerV4 contract. Calling _authorizeUpgrade to upgrade VaultManagerV4 to a new implementation is permissioned and only allowed by the owner. As a result, users interacting with the VaultManager through Proxy contract 0xb62bdb1a6ac97a9b70957dd35357311e8859f0d7 need to be aware that the logic of the VaultManager could change at any time.|0xDeD796De6a14E255487191963dEe436c45995813 (Team multisig)                  |
|VaultStakedUSDe    |setDepositCap The function setDepositCap allows the owner of the permission to set a deposit cap for each depositor of this vault. This function only exists for the sUSDe vault.|0xDeD796De6a14E255487191963dEe436c45995813 (Team multisig)                  |


## Dependencies

The Dyad protocol relies on Chainlink price feeds for collateral valuation.
In case one of the chainlink price feeds deployed to addresses `0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419` (WETH),` 0xCfE54B5cD566aB89272946F602D76Ea879CAb4a8` (stETH),` 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297` (TBTC),` 0xFF3BC18cCBd5999CE63E788A1c250a88626aD099` (sUSDe) stops working the Dyad protocol will face disruption. For each collateral price feed that stops working the respective collateral in the vault is frozen. That means the specific collateral cannot be redeemed for DYAD and the collateral cannot be withdrawn even if the collateralisation ratio was above the 150% value. Additionally liquidations for this specific asset are paused. Burning DYAD remains always possible in case of frozen oracle prices.

The protocol does not offer alternatives to replace or update the oracle dependency, as the reference addresses for these feeds are immutable. Consequently, if any Chainlink feed is discontinued, the corresponding collateral could be lost without recovery options.


## Exit Window

* Collateral Vaults
    * The multisig of the protocol team can deploy vaults, list and unlist them as collateral. The vault licenser `0xfe81952a0a2c6ab603ef1b3cc69e1b6bffa92697` has no timelock for adding and removing vaults form the registry. As mentioned above in the permission section on the VaultLicenser this can result in temporary lock of user funds.
* VaultManagerVx
    * VaultManager contract is upgradeable and currently version 4 is deployed. There is no timelock prohibiting immediately enforced upgrades to change mint, burn and liquidation implementations. This also counts for stored references to DYAD token, notes (dNft) and the vault licenser.
