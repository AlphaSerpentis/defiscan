# Assessment

## Chain

This report covers Aerodrome deployment on the Base mainnet. As Base is still evolving in terms of decentralization and governance, it does not yet meet the highest standard of decentralization (Stage 0 according to L2Beat).

## Upgradeability

The emergency council (multisig of ecosystem advocates, claimed to be credibly neutral) has a lot of control in the Aerodrome system through killing and reviving gauges. Each gauge is linked to a pool. Voters and LP both incentivized through the Aerodrome Flywheel are affected by a killed gauge which is linked to the deposited (LP) or voted (Voter) pool such that for the period in which the gauge was killed, the expected rewards stay out for this period. LPs and Voters need to allocate their capital and votes differently for the next period to profit from rewards.

We want to emphasize the presence of the `undeclared multisig`, which has been assigned to the owner role in multiple contracts, particularly in the FactoryRegistry contract. This contract grants the ability to approve or unapprove factories within the Aerodrome system. Claimed to allow extensibility of the system, it introduces severe risk of user funds if used maliciously. `approve()` allows the permission owner to approve a set of factories. The Router contract (`0xcF77a3Ba9A5CA399B7c97c74d54e5b1Beb874E43`) checks whether the submitted factory is approved with the function `isPoolFactoryApproved` exposed by the FactoryRegistry. If a factory is approved, the router allows swaps on the pools from this factory. LiquidityManagement (`addLiquidity()` or `removeLiquidity()`) is not affected, as it only allows pools from the original PoolFactory `0x420DD381b31aEf6683db6B902084cB0FFECe40Da`.

## Autonomy

Aerodrome does not have external dependencies.

## Exit Window

Aerodrome protocol does not provide a sufficient exit window for users in case of an unwanted upgrade or contract change. Changes made by the governor or the emergency council, such as killing gauges, are enforced immediately after the related transaction is processed. This immediate enforcement leaves users with no window to exit or withdraw their assets before the change is applied.

## Accessibility

Aerodrome provides multiple access points for users, including both centralized interfaces ([aerodrome.finance](https://aerodrome.finance), [alt.aerodrome.finance](https://alt.aerodrome.finance)) and decentralized interfaces on IPFS ([aero.drome.eth](https://aero.drome.eth), [aero.drome.eth.limo](https://aero.drome.eth.limo), [aero.drome.eth.link](https://aero.drome.eth.link)). This diversity in user interfaces ensures redundancy, allowing users to access the protocol even if one interface becomes unavailable.

If a factory is approved, the router allows swaps on the pools from this factory. LiquidityManagement (`addLiquidity()` or `removeLiquidity()`) is not affected, as it only allows pools from the original PoolFactory `0x420DD381b31aEf6683db6B902084cB0FFECe40Da` | Undeclared Multisig                                                    |
