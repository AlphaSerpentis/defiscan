# Assessment

## Chain

This report covers the Velodrome v2 deployment on the Optimism mainnet. As Optimism is still evolving in terms of decentralization and governance, it does not yet meet the highest standard of decentralization (Stage 1 according to L2Beat).

## Upgradeability

The emergency council (multisig of ecosystem advocates, claimed to be credibly neutral) has a lot of control in the Aerodrome system through killing and reviving gauges. Each gauge is linked to a pool. Voters and LP both incentivized through the Aerodrome Flywheel are affected by a killed gauge which is linked to the deposited (LP) or voted (Voter) pool such that for the period in which the gauge was killed, the expected rewards stay out for this period. LPs and Voters need to allocate their capital and votes differently for the next period to profit from rewards.

## Autonomy

Aerodrome does not have external dependencies.

## Exit Window

Aerodrome protocol does not provide a sufficient exit window for users in case of an unwanted upgrade or contract change. Changes made by the governor or the emergency council, such as killing gauges, are enforced immediately after the related transaction is processed. This immediate enforcement leaves users with no window to exit or withdraw their assets before the change is applied.

## Accessibility

Aerodrome provides multiple access points for users, including both centralized interfaces ([aerodrome.finance](https://aerodrome.finance), [alt.aerodrome.finance](https://alt.aerodrome.finance)) and decentralized interfaces on IPFS ([aero.drome.eth](https://aero.drome.eth), [aero.drome.eth.limo](https://aero.drome.eth.limo), [aero.drome.eth.link](https://aero.drome.eth.link)). This diversity in user interfaces ensures redundancy, allowing users to access the protocol even if one interface becomes unavailable.
